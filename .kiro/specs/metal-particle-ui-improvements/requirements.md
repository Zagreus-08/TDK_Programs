# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Metal Particle Program's user interface by improving the Resume Live button functionality and implementing proper button state management during scanning operations. The enhancement ensures better user experience by providing clear visual feedback about system state and preventing invalid operations during active scans.

## Glossary

- **Metal_Particle_System**: The Python application that displays real-time metal particle detection data with 2D and 3D visualizations
- **Resume_Live_Button**: The UI control that allows users to return to live data display mode
- **Load_Raw_Button**: The UI control that allows users to load previously saved CSV data files
- **Scan_State**: The current operational mode of the system (active scanning, idle, or paused)
- **Display_Reset**: The action of clearing current visualization data and returning to blank display state
- **Button_State_Management**: The system's ability to enable/disable UI controls based on current operational context

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the Resume Live button to reset the display to a blank state, so that I can clearly see when new scan data begins appearing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Resume Live button is clicked, THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL clear all current visualization data from both 2D and 3D plots
2. WHEN the Resume Live button is clicked, THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL restore the display to the initial blank state with grid lines and background image
3. WHEN the Resume Live button is clicked, THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL set the pause_live flag to False to resume live data processing
4. WHEN the display is reset, THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL maintain the original plot formatting and axis limits
5. WHEN the Resume Live button completes its action, THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL refresh the canvas to show the blank display immediately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want UI buttons to be automatically disabled during active scanning, so that I cannot accidentally interrupt or interfere with the scanning process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new scan is detected (coordinates 0,0), THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL disable both Load Raw Data and Resume Live buttons
2. WHEN scan data is actively being processed, THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL maintain buttons in disabled state
3. WHEN a scan completes (coordinates 100,100), THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL re-enable both Load Raw Data and Resume Live buttons
4. WHEN buttons are disabled, THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL provide visual indication that the buttons are not interactive
5. WHEN the system transitions between scan states, THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL update button states within 100 milliseconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want consistent button state management across all scanning scenarios, so that the interface behaves predictably regardless of how scans start or end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts, THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL initialize buttons in enabled state
2. WHEN an error occurs during scanning, THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL restore buttons to enabled state
3. WHEN the serial connection is lost during scanning, THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL restore buttons to enabled state
4. WHEN multiple scan cycles occur consecutively, THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL properly manage button states for each cycle
5. WHEN the pause_live flag changes state, THE Metal_Particle_System SHALL evaluate and update button availability accordingly
